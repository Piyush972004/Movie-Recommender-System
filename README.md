#🎬 Movie Recommender System

Welcome to the Movie Recommender System!

This project is built to recommend movies to users based on their preferences using machine learning techniques.

📌 Features
Recommend movies based on selected titles

User-friendly interface

Uses similarity scores to suggest top movies

Powered by machine learning and Python libraries

Responsive and clean UI built with Streamlit (or specify your framework if different)

🔥 How to Run Locally
Clone the repository:
-git clone https://github.com/Piyush972004/Movie-Recommender-System.git

Navigate to the project directory
-cd Movie-Recommender-System

Install the required packages
-pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application
-streamlit run app.py

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8501

🧠 How It Works
The model calculates cosine similarity between movies.

Based on the selected movie, it recommends the top 5 similar movies.

Uses preprocessed movie data and precomputed similarity matrix for fast recommendation.

📈 Future Improvements
Add user-based or content-based collaborative filtering

Integrate with TMDB API for real-time movie posters and descriptions

Deploy it online (Streamlit Cloud / Heroku / Render)
