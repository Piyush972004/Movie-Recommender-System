Run the application
-streamlit run app.py

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8501

<h1>🧠 How It Works</h1>
The model calculates cosine similarity between movies.

Based on the selected movie, it recommends the top 5 similar movies.

Uses preprocessed movie data and precomputed similarity matrix for fast recommendation.

<h1>📈 Future Improvements</h1>
Add user-based or content-based collaborative filtering

Integrate with TMDB API for real-time movie posters and descriptions

Deploy it online (Streamlit Cloud / Heroku / Render)
